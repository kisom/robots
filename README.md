# Robots

I like building robots. This is PlatformIO code for the non-ROS robots.

* [Scooter](https://hackaday.io/project/166550-scooter) is a 2WD robot
  with an array of ultrasonic ranging sensors. It's an experiment in
  obstacle avoidance.

Other robots:

* [krex](https://hackaday.io/project/166400-krex) is a ROS robot based
  on the Jetson Nano; source is in the [krex-ros](https://github.com/kisom/krex-ros)
  repository.
